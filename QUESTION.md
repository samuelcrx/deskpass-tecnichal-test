>  Systems like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are the end result of years and years of effort spent slowly abstracting server resources from being "a single physical machine your app is running on" to "a distributed pool of generic resources any app can run on." What do you think the next level of server abstraction will look like in 10 years? How will web apps be deployed and managed a decade from now? Will container management systems such as Kubernetes still be used, or will there be another layer of abstraction used?"

When it comes to cloud computing, it is very difficult to say about the next
10 years, given that this technology has grown and developed more and more.
A great example is the reality that the world is increasingly focused on an architecture
cloud computing, and in this segmentop there are several technologies and solutions, such as
containers, serverless architecture and shared infrastructures.

Cloud computing is indeed a self-sustaining and powerful technology, mainly by
it is a basic, viable and functional solution for companies. And we also have technologies
which have been increasingly important and used, such as Edge Networks, Internet of Things (IoT)
and even cryptocurrencies.

About web application development, I can recall how complex it was to scale applications
large-scale by utilizing technologies such as NGINX or ISS and also deploying them, but with the rise of the
Docker and Kubernets has been increasingly realistic the idea of the ease of application development,
implementation and sharing of them.

Therefore, I believe that the deployment of web applications a decade from now will be simpler for everyone and
we will probably make use of container management systems, such as Kubernets, which no longer only uses Docker,
but other container runtimes like CRI-O.
